> "This is a place to know the new and the best movies.".

Hello! 

Welcome to this repository, here you can have access to many movies, of all the categories and many options for choose what movie you will watch this weekend.

For example, about the categories in this app:
- Action
- Adventure
- Animation
- Comedy
- Crime
- Documentary
- Horror
- Mystery 

And many more!

To create this application it was necessary to use the very famous [TheMovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3 "TheMovieDB") API, which gives us access to a lot of information for the different sections of the application, it gives us options such as **Trendings**,  **Popular Movies**, **Now Playing**, **Top Rated**, and many more, but this time I decided to use the above four options. For more information you can enter the previous link.

Another functionality that this app offers you is the possibility to see how the popularity of each movie is, you can see the overview of the movies, the actors who work in that movie, and you can see Similar Movies taking into account the movie that you have selected.

You have a visual example to see how the functionality of the application is, you just have to scroll down a bit: :grin:

> This app uses the [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage "LocalStorage")  tool, which is useful for data persistence, and in this way we can navigate the page without problems. If you want to know more about this tool you can do click on the prevous link.

## Available Scripts
- **npm start**
	Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

	The page will reload when you make changes.
	You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- **npm test**
	Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

- **npm run build**
	Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- **npm run eject**
	If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

	Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
